# Digital-Signal-Processing-Spectrogram-using-STFT
## Intorduction:
The aim of this project is to build up an analytical system based on the spectrogram using
Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to assist neurologists in monitoring and diagnosing
epileptic electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Epilepsy is a disorder in the electrical activity
of the brain that causes repetitive and unprovoked seizures. In general, the epileptic EEG signal
is characterized by two main states: interictal and ictal. The interictal state is considered the
period between seizures while the ictal state is the period of a seizure which is characterized by
its large spikes. Other states (i.e., preictal and postictal) are out of our scope in this project.
CHB-MIT [1] is the source of the EEG records that will be used for this project and found in this
